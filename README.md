Extend the tutorlms interface for improved admin support. The goal is to add better visibility overall to student progress, primarily from an admin perspective. TutorLMS gives sufficient admin screen support for individual users, but is somewhat limited in overview. It was written to support an online institute that has a smaller student base with significant investment in each student. 

# Pending Features:
- Admin screen showing students' course enrollment, with ability to add notes for each course
- Admin screen showing students' registration information as well as ability to add additional details/notes
- Introduce proctor/supervisor support:
   -  Track attendance
   -  Proctor's ability to update student progress or add notes

# Completed Features:
- Git repo created :P
